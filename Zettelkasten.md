# Zettelkasten

- [[index]]
- [[Organization]]

In my Zettlekasten I currentl have two kinds of links:
1. Links that are capitalized are topic links. In those files I list files that are related by topic
2. Links that are lower case are links to files that have information on a specific topic. That topic may belong to multiple Categories.

## My Method
- I also have an [[index]] that has links that are both capitalized and lower case which allows me to jump around in my notes.
- In each topic file I have links at the top of the file that take me to the index and to the topic file so that I am able to quickly navigate between and through various topics
- If a topic is to big or to small I can break it down or condense it in order to facilitate organization.



Zettlekasten is not about organization, but about thinking.
